%/* Draw a pair of null cones (NC). 
%
% Command: \nullCones{pos}{g NC parameterss}{f NC parameters}
%
% Parameters (with defaults): x=0, y=1, a=1, b=0.5, rotate = 0.
%
%   The top ellipse is at (x,y) with axes (a,b). 
%   The null cone is optionally rotated by an angle.
%   Layers can be back, front, or outline.
%
% \nullConesOutline draws only an outline of the null cones.
% \nullConesShaded draws the fully shaded null cones.
%
% By default \nullCones = \nullConesShaded (controlled by \ifOutline).
%
% Examples:
%
%   \coordinate (nc2) at (-0.5,2.5);
%   \nullCones{nc1}{ x=  0.1, y= 1  , a= 1  , b= 0.3  }
